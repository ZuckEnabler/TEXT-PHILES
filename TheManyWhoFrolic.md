# The Many Who Frolic
The Many Who Frolic are the countless acolytes who dedicate themselves to the daily rhythms of the Forest, ensuring that its abundance, joy, and harmony are maintained for all who live within or visit. They do not hold ranks or titles beyond their shared purpose and live in a state of communal devotion to Frolic itself.

* Tend the marshmallow groves with careful hands, ensuring that each tree is nurtured and celebrated.

* Harvest LSFA Mallows with a delicate touch, practicing centuries-old techniques to preserve their purity and fluffiness.

* Guide visitors in their Frolic, welcoming them into the experience while ensuring they respect the customs of the Forest.

* Study and teach within the University of the Forest, engaging in ecological sciences, economic philosophy, and the metaphysical studies of Frolic.

* Maintain the ether swamps, ensuring that their natural state remains balanced and undisturbed, preventing the dangers of over-accumulation or instability.

* Join in the rituals and celebrations of the Forest, reaffirming their connection to the land, to each other, and to the joyous state of being that defines their way of life.

Though the Many Who Frolic have no titles, no personal wealth, and no ambitions beyond their shared purpose, their role is the most essential of allâ€”for it is through their hands, hearts, and spirits that the Marshmallow Forest remains as it has always been: a place of boundless joy, effortless wonder, and the purest expression of Frolic itself.
